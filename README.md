## Hi there 👋 I'm Aubay Azzarouk

🎓 **Computational Data Sciences Major | Mathematics Minor** at Penn state University - College of Engineering

😄 I’m passionate, curious, and results-driven, with a strong interest in using data science to tackle real-world challenges and deliver meaningful, practical solutions.

💡  My focus lies in designing, analyzing, developing, and implementing advanced algorithms, architectures, and software/hardware systems for efficient data management and decision-making.

📊 I specialize in complex data pipelines and end-to-end solutions, from ETL and EDA, to modeling, visualization and automation - with an emphasis on business impact and actionable insights.

🌱 My interests span business intelligence, artificial intelligence, climate-aware analytics, and startup ecosystems.

💻 This Github portfolio combines both academic and personal experience, showcasing work in analytics, ML research, business strategy, and projects in data science/engineering.

 🧠 About My Degree (DTSCE_BS)
Penn State’s **Computational Data Sciences (DTSCE_BS)** program, exclusive to the College of Engineering, combines deep training in computer science, algorithms, and systems with a strong emphasis on mathematics, statistics, and analytics on dynamic datasets.

I’ve completed coursework in:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Machine Learning & AI
- Data Engineering Design
- Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, and Mathematical Statistics
- SQL, Python, Java, OOP, and Technical Writing

With hands-on exposure to topics like:

- ETL pipelines, data cleaning, and statistical modeling  
- Supervised/semi/unsupervised learning  
- Model evaluation, classification, and ensemble methods  
- Feature engineering, regularization, and deep learning architectures (DNN, RNN, ANN)  
- NLP, sampling techniques, and reinforcement learning

During my most recent semester, I managed an 18-credit course load while also joining a student-led research group (**ML @ PSU**). While this limited my GitHub activity, I’m currently revitalizing this space through new personal projects and continued learning.
