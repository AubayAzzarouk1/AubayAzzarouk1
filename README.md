## Hi there 👋 I'm Aubay Azzarouk

🎓 **Computational Data Sciences Major | Mathematics Minor** at Penn state University - College of Engineering

😄 I’m passionate, curious, and results-driven, with a strong interest in using data science to tackle real-world challenges and deliver meaningful, practical solutions.

💡  My focus lies in designing, analyzing, developing, and implementing advanced algorithms, architectures, and software/hardware systems for efficient data management and decision-making.

📊 I specialize in complex data pipelines and end-to-end solutions, from ETL and EDA, to modeling, visualization and automation - with an emphasis on business impact and actionable insights.

🌱 My interests span business intelligence, artificial intelligence, climate-aware analytics, and startup ecosystems.

⚡ Fun fact: I love geography 🌎

💻 This Github portfolio combines both academic and personal experience, showcasing work in analytics, ML research, business strategy, and projects in data science/engineering.

 ## 🧠 About My Degree (DTSCE_BS)
Penn State’s **Computational Data Sciences (DTSCE_BS)** program, exclusive to the College of Engineering, combines deep training in computer science, algorithms, and systems with a strong emphasis on mathematics, statistics, and analytics on dynamic datasets.

I’ve completed coursework in:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Database Management
- Machine Learning & AI
- Probability Theory
- Data Engineering Design
- Data Ethics & Governance 
- Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Mathematical Statistics
- SQL, Python, Java, OOP, and Technical Writing & Documentation

With hands-on exposure and training to topics like:

- **Data Pipelines & Modelings**: ETL, Statistical modeling, EDA, Regularization, feature engineering

- **Machine Learning**: Model Evaluation, Supervised/Semi/Unsupervised Learning, Classification, Ensemble Methods

- **Model Evaluation**: Model Performance, Sampling Methods, Bias/Fairness, Interpretability

- **Business Intelligence & Analytics**: KPI Tracking, Dashboarding (Excel, Power BI), Financial Modeling, Trend Analysis, Reporting

- **Deep Learning**: ANN's, DNN's, RNN's, Gradients, Reinforcement Learning 

- **Domains**: Natural Language Processing, Climate-Aware Learning, Geospatial Analytics

  During my most recent semester, I managed an 18-credit course load while also joining a student-led research group (**ML @ PSU**). While this limited my GitHub activity, I’m currently revitalizing this space through new personal projects and continued learning.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

- **Expanding Wildfire Prediction Research:** Building upon my work with an enhanced U-Net + Convolutional LSTM Architecture for more accurate California Wildfire Forecasting. Currently refining multimodal pipeline through learning how to produce more robust ground truth labeling, imrpoved evaluation metrics (beyond precision and recall as it is not a conclusive definition towards what it means to be accurate), and investigating feature sensitivity to spatial uncertainity. This work aims to improve model interpretability and operational readiness for real-world deployment.

- **Portfolio Website:** Creating a static website from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS to showcase projects, experienced and skills. 

🔍 **Currently Exploring**
- Real-world deployments for climate-aware AI
- Automizing Financial Analysis (on 10-Q/K reports) with the help of Artificial Intelligence
- Microsoft Fabric and Synapse for end-to-end BI workflows  
- Snowflake schema modeling
